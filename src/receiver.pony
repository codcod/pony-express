/*
Receiver and processing pipeline actors.

This module contains three cooperating actors:

- `Receiver`: receives raw message requests (from the web server
  or other producers), assigns a monotonically increasing id and
  constructs a concrete `OutboundMessage`.
- `Processor`: performs simple validation and enrichment of an
  `OutboundMessage`, producing a `ProcessedMessage` that includes
  a metadata map (e.g. `processed_at` and `gateway_key`). If
  validation fails (empty recipient) the message is dropped.
- `Router`: routes a `ProcessedMessage` to the appropriate
  gateway actor (`EmailGateway`, `SmsGateway` or `PushGateway`) by
  inspecting the message kind.

The module is intentionally small: the actors are examples of how
to structure an actor-based pipeline in Pony.
